# 🌾 Systems Developer • Mod Architect

I'm **Tison**, a 24-year-old Farming Simulator systems developer from the Netherlands.

I build immersive gameplay systems that:

- Integrate seamlessly into base game logic  
- Enhance realism without artificial complexity  
- Prioritize performance and stability  
- Follow modular, maintainable Lua architecture  

> **Immersion first. Performance always.**

- **TicketBot** — Advanced ticketing system with logging  
- **GitBot** — GitHub → Discord webhook forwarder

# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

**The best mod is the one you forget is a mod.**

Complexity must earn its place.  
Performance is non-negotiable.
